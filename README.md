# React Native Shopping App
This is a React Native application that simulates a shopping experience. The app allows users to browse products, add items to their cart, view the cart, and proceed to checkout.

The key features include a Home Screen that displays a list of products, a Product Screen that shows detailed information about a selected product, a Cart Screen that allows users to manage their cart items, and a Checkout Screen that displays a summary of the cart.

The design choices include the use of UI components like FlatList, Image, TouchableOpacity, and Text, navigation using React Navigation, and consistent and responsive styling through StyleSheet and Flexbox.

The app also leverages AsyncStorage to persist cart data locally on the device, and manages the state of cart items using useState to ensure data persistence across app sessions.
